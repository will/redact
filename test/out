This file is an input file. There will be some secrets in here, and also
some non secrets.  For example there hasn't been anything yet that
should be redacted, but say I put in a link to
http://will:<redacted>@bitfission.com then I'd hope that my redact tool
would successfully redact out that password there. Also if my database
url was in this document (but I'd never put in
postgres://u123:<redacted>@site.com:5432/dbname in something public like this)
I'd also hope that redact would redact out that password.

There should also be test for arbitrary words in a .redactrc file but
that'll be step two I suppose.

Make sure that two things on the same line both get redacted:
postgres://u123:<redacted>@site.com:5432/dbname postgres://u123:<redacted>@site.com:5432/dbname
